+Modified pyaudio rpm is [here](https://github.com/colin-i/pyaudioo/releases).\
+```rpm -i --nodeps``` and ```yum remove --noautoremove``` to deal at pyaudioo...rpm, audapa...rpm and python3-pyaudio.\
 PortAudio can ask for portaudio.h (the file is in portaudio19-dev).\
 PortAudio and python 3.10 can report playback errors (install from [here](https://git.skeh.site/skeh/pyaudio) and add libportaudio2 package).\
 The audio records are saved where *appdirs.user_data_dir("audapa")* points at (example: ~/.local/share/audapa/1650089398.wav).\
