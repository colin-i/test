#at question(or near that):

#normally nothing here at added new at _new, but if few changes interrupt, still need a has_new=x ./c _new (also at a.py and ./b _new before that)
#when from new to normal: move from: recs_new to recs, move from current_new to current, enter; after that also move from: new_new,ex_new,ex2_new
#when from normal to out: use python nlist.py , remove from: recs text text_last current new ex ex2
